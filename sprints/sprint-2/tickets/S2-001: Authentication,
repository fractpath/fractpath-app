S2-001 — Authentication (Minimal, Boring, Safe)
ROLE

You are an execution agent working on FractPath.

Your job is to implement Sprint 2, Ticket S2-001: Authentication, exactly as specified below.

You must prioritize:

correctness

minimalism

future optionality

You must not introduce new product scope, UX semantics, or deal logic.

CONTEXT (READ CAREFULLY)

FractPath is a fractional home-equity exploration platform.

At this stage:

Scenarios are pre-deal

Nothing is binding

Authentication exists only to allow users to return and retrieve what they explored

This sprint is intentionally conservative.

SPRINT 2 UX CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Authentication must:

Feel like “remember me”

NOT feel like “apply”, “commit”, or “sign up for a deal”

Avoid legal or financial seriousness

Avoid over-designed UX

Authentication must not:

Imply approval, eligibility, or deal readiness

Introduce profiles, roles, or permissions

Introduce multi-user access

Introduce deal IDs or property verification

Introduce sharing or collaboration

If you are unsure whether something violates this → do not add it.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1. Authentication Method

Use a managed authentication provider (Supabase Auth, Clerk, Auth0, or equivalent already configured)

Email + password authentication only

Use default provider UI or minimal wrapper

No custom password rules

No custom recovery flows

Auth must support:

Sign up

Log in

Log out

Password reset / recovery (provider default)

2. UX Scope (Minimal)

You may include:

A basic auth page

Clear but neutral copy like:

“Sign in to continue exploring”

“We’ll save what you’ve been exploring”

You must avoid:

“Apply”

“Submit”

“Get approved”

“Create a deal”

“Lock in terms”

3. Session Handling

Authenticated session must persist

Logged-in users should be identifiable server-side

Unauthenticated users can still access public scenario builder (existing behavior)

4. Routing Rules

Public routes remain accessible without auth

Auth is required only for:

scenario retrieval (future tickets)

saving scenarios (future tickets)

Do not block scenario generation behind auth yet.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MUST ALL PASS)

 User can sign up with email/password

 User can log in

 User can log out

 User can reset password via provider flow

 Session persists across refresh

 No deal or commitment language introduced

 No new product objects created

 No breaking changes to Sprint 1 functionality

EXPLICIT NON-GOALS (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)

Profiles

User settings pages

Roles (buyer/seller/realtor)

MFA

OAuth / social login

Deal IDs

Property IDs

Scenario persistence (that is S2-002)

DELIVERABLES

When finished, report only:

What was added (high level)

What files changed

How to test auth locally

Any risks or assumptions

Do not include verbose logs or transcripts unless something failed.

FAILURE MODE HANDLING

If you encounter:

provider configuration errors

env issues

framework conflicts

Fix them only insofar as needed to complete auth.

Do not refactor unrelated systems.

FINAL REMINDER

Your goal is identity continuity, not product maturity.

If you feel tempted to improve UX, add structure, or “make it better”:
👉 stop — that belongs in later sprints.
