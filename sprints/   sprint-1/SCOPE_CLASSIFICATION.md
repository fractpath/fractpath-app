| Identify authoritative source of `fractPathScenarioSummary` | Determine where the scenario summary is generated and finalized | **HUMAN-ONLY** | Requires product judgment about semantic ownership and prevents silent meaning drift |
| Assemble `fractPathScenarioSummary` deterministically       | Ensure summary is built in one consistent location              | **HYBRID**     | Human freezes meaning; agent can implement deterministic assembly                    |
| Validate HubSpot property existence and writability         | Confirm property exists, matches key, and is API-writable       | **AGENTIC**    | Pure plumbing and verification work                                                  |
| Ensure HubSpot payload includes non-empty summary           | Confirm API calls send populated value                          | **AGENTIC**    | Mechanical execution aligned to frozen intent                                        |
| Handle create vs update logic correctly                     | Ensure summary is written on contact create/update              | **AGENTIC**    | Implementation detail with low product risk                                          |
| Add safe inspection/logging for payload confirmation        | Confirm what is sent without persisting sensitive data          | **HYBRID**     | Human defines safety boundaries; agent implements                                    |
| Detect and surface HubSpot write failures                   | Make failures explicit, not silent                              | **AGENTIC**    | Execution-only error handling                                                        |
| Document final data flow                                    | Explain intake → summary → HubSpot flow                         | **AGENTIC**    | Documentation task with no product judgment                                          |
