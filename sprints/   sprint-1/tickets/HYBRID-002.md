# HYBRID-002 — Deterministic Scenario Summary Assembly

## Problem Statement
Scenario summaries may be empty or inconsistent due to fragmented assembly logic.

## Human-Frozen Intent
- Summary assembly must be deterministic.
- All currently collected scenario inputs must be reflected.
- Formatting may change, meaning may not.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Summary is always non-empty when intake is complete.
- Summary reflects all user-provided inputs.
- Partial submissions fail explicitly.

## Implementation Boundaries
- Agent controls formatting and assembly mechanics.
- Agent may not infer or compute new values.

## Data & Security Notes
- No persistence outside intended storage.
- No logging of full summaries.

## Out of Scope
- New scenario attributes
- Calculations or projections

## PR Requirements
- Checklist mapping input fields → summary presence.
